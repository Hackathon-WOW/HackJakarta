## Project Description
GROW is an app that aims to empower Indonesian SMEs by providing an application that simplifies the creation of financial visualizations and reports for investors. The primary objective is to enhance financial transparency, facilitate access to funding, and improve decision-making for SMEs. Key features include automated financial report generation, intuitive data visualizations, and educational resources on financial management. During the hackathon, we enhanced the application with real-time data integration, optimized report templates for investor presentations, and resolved usability issues to ensure a seamless user experience.

GROW is developed by Hackathon Wow Team for HackJakarta that focus on solving the critical issue of **Financial Inclusion**. Jakarta is experiencing a digital boom, opening new opportunities for small vendors who may face challenges in adopting new technologies. Our solution aims to integrate this demographic into the wider economy, making the digital transition smooth and beneficial.
